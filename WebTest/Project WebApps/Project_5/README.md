# Project 5
## Javascript Calculator

"Design a web page that looks and behaves like a classic calculator. There should be buttons for the digits 0-9, basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and an = button. Your calculator should also have a memory feature, with corresponding buttons (e.g., MS, MR, M+). Finally, your calculator should have a way to clear the display and clear memory. This is the minimum set of features your calculator must have. But you may choose to add more features such as: more arithmetic operators (square root, exponentiation), more modes (hex/binary/decimal, degrees/radians), more functions (trigonometry). Implement the calculator functionality using Javascript. You may layout your calculator interface as an HTML table."

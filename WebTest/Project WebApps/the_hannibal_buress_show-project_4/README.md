# Project 4
## Static Web Site Design

###First time running program?

Please run the following command in the program directory to ensure the proper gems are installed: bundle install which requires the use of bundle.

See [ruby gems](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~shareef/3901.sp15/labs/gems.html) for further information if bundle is not installed on your system. Most notably steps 1 and 3 in the Step-by-Step section should be followed.

To run the program the following command should be submitted:  bundle exec middleman
The command will start an middleman server that when opened in the firefox browser will show a 
demo of the website redesign. See [middleman  documentation](https://middlemanapp.com) for deployment.

# Project 3
## Web Scraping

### First time running program?
Please run the following command in the program directory to ensure the 
proper gems are installed: <code>bundle install</code> 
which requires the use of bundle. 

See [ruby gems](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~shareef/3901.sp15/labs/gems.html)
for further information if bundle is not installed on your system.
Most notably steps 1 and 3 in the Step-by-Step section should be followed. 

To run the program the following command should be submitted: 
<code> bundle exec ruby JobScrapes.rb</code>


### How this program works
Enter the keyword of job you want to search and you can find the results(within the same directory) in a nicely formatted html file named "JobSearch.html"
